# VueJS Challange

This test is meant to not only assess your grasp of the technology used in our Project Team but also to give you an idea of how we work - if you take joy in the challenge, chances are you will love working with us!

Feel free to contact us with any questions you might have about the tasks below!

Now onward to the the Challenge!

## Prologue
You just joined a small Team on its epic quest to implement the best Todo web app there ever was! The team already setup this project as a start - but now it's on you to do your share in this endeavor to change the world as we know it.

## Chapter One - Your first Task!
Monday morning - you just set up your office space and enjoy the random slack channel when suddenly you project manager assigns you your first task! it reads:

    Alice would like to be able to see the not-checked items in the Todolist at the top and have the checked ones at the bottom of the list, so she can see her tasks that need to be done first.

    please implement this feature as your first task!

## Chapter Two - UX matters!

After finishing your first task you feel pretty good about yourself! You had a delightful lunch break at noon but now it's time to grab the next issue from the sprint backlog.

    Users complain that the timestamp displayed after the Text of the ToDo items are always saying `5 minutes ago` even if they created that Todo an hour ago - plx fix asap!

Upon a quick glance at the codebase you notice that Frank did not implement this feature at all but just put a static text in there before leaving for an 8 week vacation to an unspecified remote location - your other colleagues just shrug: 'classic Frank!'

Please come the the rescue and implement this 'TimeAgo-Feature' correctly.

## Chapter Three - cleaning up the mess!

Directly after reviewing you Merge Request the big red phone starts to ring - everyone looks nervous while Greg takes a deep breath and picks up the phone visibly shaking...

It's the European Supreme Court of Justice - they remind your team that everyone has a right to be forgotten - and that your team will need to add a feature to remove Todo items forever or face the consequences!

Naturally everyone looks at you - as the PM silently assignes you to an issue that has been lurking in the backlog since the beginning of time:

    Some figurehead wanted us to add a Remove button next to the Todo Items to delete them forever - he sounded really important.

    Looks like we finally get to implement this to do in the store - don't forget to add a corresponding unittest! 

    -Frank

Can you avert this crysis and save the day once again?

You made it! Your Team can continue on their quest to create the best Todo web app ever! Well done!
